			<h2>The Centralized Calendar Project</h2>
			<p>
				The project to create a multifaceted, centralized, online community calendar for Muncie
				began at TheMuncieScene.com in 2003, with a focus on Muncie's arts and entertainment 
				community, as well as community activism. To better incorporate a wider scope of community
				events and to allow TheMuncieScene.com to return to its focus on local arts and activism, this
				is being broken off as a separate project, located online at 
				<a href="http://MuncieEvents.com">MuncieEvents.com</a>.
			</p>
			
			<h2>The Vision</h2>
			<p>
				Muncie's centralized calendar project is supported by the 
				<a href="http://FullCircleArtsCoOp.org">Full Circle Arts Co-op</a>, which believes a strong
				community should be supported by an all-inclusive promotional tool that serves individuals,
				small organizations, and large businesses equally, represents all geographical 
				and cultural segments fairly, and is in constant development according to
				the needs of the community and the advancement of Internet technology.
			</p>
			
			<h2>The Plan</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Inviting the community to take part in planning the development of the project in 
					<a href="http://fullcircleartscoop.org/meetings">monthly meetings</a>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Pooling event information into a central database
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Delivering event information through a variety of methods:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Customized calendar at MuncieEvents.com
						</li>
						<li>
							Widgets on community websites showing all events, a specific category of 
							events, or only events taking place at a specific location.
						</li>
						<li>
							A customizable mailing list that delivers daily or weekly emails with upcoming 
							event information.
						</li>
						<li>
							A monthly printed newsletter with upcoming event information.
						</li>
						<li>									
							RSS feeds and integration into other online calendar applications.
						</li>
